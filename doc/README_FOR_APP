GetPaid (working title)

This is a simple Rails billing app I started in 2006. 
It's very basic and certain parts of it are unfinished, 
but for basic billing, it's worked well for me.

Features:
    - Invoicing
    - Service rates
    - Subcontracting support
    - Basic contact management
    - Simple layout
    
Setup
    1. Copy config/database.example.yml to config/database.yml, and edit.
    2. Copy config/user_prefs.example.yml to config/user_prefs.yml and edit.
    3. rake db:create
    4. run ./go
    5. open browser to http://localhost:3001 and start billing!
